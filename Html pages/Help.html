	<b>Q. How can I create an IRCTC account login ID?<br></b>
A: To create a new IRCTC login ID, visit the official home page of the IRCTC. Right below the login box, there is an option to sign up. When you click on it, a registration box will open. Now enter your user ID, password, security question, and preferred language, followed by personal information like name, gender, Aadhaar card number, PAN card number and your residential address. After you enter all the information, click on submit. For the verification of your IRCTC login account, a link will be sent to your registered email ID. Your registration process is now complete, and you are ready to use your IRCTC account. Watch this video to see all the steps described above

A: Making your login ID is a one-time registration process. Once you have registered, you cannot change your username or the login credentials for a given email address.
<br><br>
<b>Q. How can I log into my IRCTC account?<br></b>
A: For IRCTC login, open the ixigo app and just log in using your registered username. Next, select the departure and arrival destinations, date of travel, the class you want to travel in, and your traveller details. Then, click on ‘Pay Now’ to complete the payment. Once it is successful, the app will ask you to enter your password. Do this, and make your booking.

<b>Q. What is the maximum number of IRCTC train tickets one can book at a time?<br></b>
A: As per IRCTC, maximum number of bookings allowed per month = 12 and maximum number of passengers booked per ticket = 6. So, a maximum of 36 passengers can be booked in a month from IRCTC ID.

<b>Q. How can I recover my IRCTC user ID and password?<br></b>

<b>Q. How can I book railway tickets by mobile?<br></b>
A: You can book railway tickets on mobile by using the ixigo trains app, or by visiting websites. Simply choose your route, date and preferred seat; update passenger details (including the IRCTC user ID); and make the payment to book your ticket. During COVID-19, you must also share your destination address, for contact tracing as per government regulations.
<br><br>
<b>Q. How do I cancel the IRCTC train ticket after the train has departed?<br></b>
A: If a railway booking is confirmed, it can be cancelled up to 48 hours before the scheduled departure of the train. As per IRCTC website, tickets booked online cannot be cancelled after the chart is prepared.
<br><br>
<b>Q. Are children charged for IRCTC train tickets booking?<br></b>
A: Children under 5 years of age are not charged for a train journey. Children between 5 to 12 years of age are charged fully if a berth is sought for the child separately. However, if a berth/seat is not required for a child between 5 to 12 years of age, then only half of the adult fare will be applicable.
<br><br>
<b>Q. What is TDR in IRCTC?<br></b>
A: TDR refers to the ticket deposit receipt. Passengers who have a ticket but have not travelled, and want to apply for a refund, can file for a TDR. The IRCTC provides facilities to file TDR online. If the train chart is not prepared, users can cancel their ticket online. It is only after a chart is ready that a TDR needs to be filed for a refund. Some different scenarios where an IRCTC TDR can be filed are:
